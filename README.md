# About Application
It is an application for athletes in which the user can determine what his training should look like and how long it should take. The application contains favorite times so that the user does not have to set them again and a history in which completed times can be seen. The application runs in the background and the user controls the time outside the application. The application has sound signals thanks to which it knows which phase of training it is currently in.
